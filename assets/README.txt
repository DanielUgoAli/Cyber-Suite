Place your "logo.png" file in this directory to be used as the application icon.

Requirements for logo.png:
- Format: PNG is recommended for best cross-platform compatibility
- Size: Ideally 64x64 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
- Transparency: Use transparent background for best results

The application will automatically look for a file named "logo.png" in this directory
and use it as the application icon.
